### GET (item)
	int emailId = 1;	
	Email email = client.Assets.Email.Get(emailId);

### GET (list)
	List<Email> emails = client.Assets.Email.Get("searchTerm", pageNumber, pageSize);

### POST
	Email email = new Email() {...};
	email = client.Assets.Email.Post(Email);

### PUT
	Email email = new Email() { ... };	
	email = client.Assets.Email.Put(Email);

### DELETE

	client.Assets.Email.Delete(emailId);

## Endpoint URL
To determine the base url, you can use the following endpoint : login.eloqua.com/id 
The endpoint, when called with basic authentication, will return details about the URLs for the various APIs.
     
```json
{
    "site": {
        "id": 42,
        "name": "SampleClient"
    },
    "user": {
        "id": 314,
        "username": "Fred Sakr",
        "displayName": "Fred Sakr",
        "firstName": "Fred",
        "lastName": "Sakr",
        "emailAddress": "fred.sakr@oracle.com"
    },
    "urls": {
        "base": "https://www05.secure.eloqua.com",
        "apis"	...
	}
}
```
